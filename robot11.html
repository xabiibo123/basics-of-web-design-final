        What is obotic? What Will Robots Be Like in the Future? you are here
        Home / Karel Blog / Technology and Innovation What is Robotics? What
        Will Robots Be Like in the Future? The term robot comes from the Slavic
        word "robota" meaning labor or drudgery. The term "robot" as a term for
        humanoid machines first appeared in Czech author Karel Čapek's
        (1890–1938) play Rossums Universal Robots. Isaac Asimov, a science
        fiction writer, first mentioned robots in 1942 in his short story
        “Runaround”. However, the desire and idea of ​​producing automatic
        machines goes back much further. Leonardo Da Vinci made sketches and
        plans for robot construction. Humans have always been fascinated by
        creating machines that can perform or interact with tasks. According to
        Thomas Christaller, robots are "sensor-powered machines that allow to
        expand human capacity." Robots are made up of mechatronic components,
        sensors, and computer-based control functions. Robotics is a
        multidisciplinary science that deals with the design, manufacture, and
        use of robots. Although robots are intended to be used in many different
        situations, today they are mostly used in dangerous missions, in space,
        underwater, high temperature and radiation environments where human
        beings cannot live. Robots can be made in any shape, and some robots are
        made to be human-like. It is thought that this will facilitate the
        acceptance of robots by humans. What Are the Main Components of the
        Robot? Computing: Robots have central processing units called
        controllers that determine the actions they will take in a given
        situation, the controllers can be programmed to perform tasks as simple
        as turning a screw or as complex as mimicking a human's social behaviors
        and expressions. sharp
