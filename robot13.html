          Walmart has upped the ante for its big box and grocery store
          counterparts by obtaining a patent for long-anticipated <br />
          robotic shopping carts. The robotic carts (created by Alert
          Innovation) are poised to transform operations for <br />
          store teams and enhance the shopping experience for customers. The
          technology utilizes Roomba-like motorized transport units attached
          <br />
          to the bottom of traditional shopping carts. And Walmart’s technology
          provides just a glimpse at how shopping cart technology <br />
          might evolve over the next decade.

          Walmart’s carts will operate on a “central control circuit” that uses
          a wireless network, video cameras, and sensors to do its bidding.
          Irked by idle <br />
          shopping carts obstructing your selling floor or crowding your parking
          lot? The system clocks each cart’s idle time and then uses image
          sensors to make sure <br />
          the cart is empty and no longer in use. What’s more, idle carts will
          return themselves to docks, so forget about having to send <br />
          a human employee to do so. The bots are poised to do more for store
          ops than just clear inactive carts, according to <br />
          Kate Taylor’s article for Business Insider. It seems that Walmart is
          considering applying the motorized transport units to more than
          shopping carts. Walmart’s patent allows <br />
          for a wide range of uses, and the technology can potentially move
          shipping containers, retrieve and deliver stock, manage inventory, and
          dispose of trash. But, <br />
          we’ll have to wait to see whether and how soon these functions come to
          fruition. It’s worth noting that Walmart’s isn’t the only hand in the
          game. Five Elements <br />
          Robotics garnered buzz when they introduced the DASH Robot Shopping
          Cart at the 2018 National Retail Federation annual convention and expo
          in New York City. Beyond the prospective benefits for customers <br />
          (outlined in the next section), Five Elements highlights DASH’s
          ability to increase sales, expand customer base, reduce losses from
          theft, and provide real time inventory data and analytics. <br />

          DASH’s development is still underway. Still, the technology has some
          features that retailers can get excited about. Specifically, Five
          Elements is <br />
          planning to use DASH to collect data on customer buying trends, thus
          helping buying and planning teams <br />
          make informed, strategic decisions. It’s not clear, however, how the
          carts may provide more comprehensive data than the existing <br />
          technology. Nonetheless, with proper floor set up, DASH might
          strategically lead customers through stores past featured displays to
          ultimately drive sales. DASH’s screen could provide targeted
          advertisements, <br />
          reducing marketing costs for adopters.
