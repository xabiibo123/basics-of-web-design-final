            <h1>This article is about mechanical robots.</h1>
            <p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2] <br> A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. <br> Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.</p>
