         <p>Robotics is a multidisciplinary science that deals with the design, <br> production and use of robots. It is a common field of study of mechanical engineering, <br> aeronautical engineering,[1] aerospace engineering,[2] electronic engineering, computer engineering, <br> mechatronics engineering and control engineering. Robots are complex machines that are managed through software <br> and produce work and value for a useful purpose.

            Robotics technology aims to build machines that can replace <br> humans or mimic human actions. Although robots are intended to be used in many different situations, today they are <br> mostly used in hazardous environments[3] (e.g. bomb disposal[4]), production processes,[5] or in space, <br> underwater, high temperature and radiation environments where humans <br> cannot live. Although robots can be made in any form, some robots are made <br> to resemble humans. This is thought to facilitate the acceptance of robots by humans. Many robots  are  inspired by <br> nature and are the subject of bio-inspired robotics.[3]
