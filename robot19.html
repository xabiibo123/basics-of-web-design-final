        ROPOT – THE INTELLIGENT ROBOT COOKER - THE SMART POT Now available in
        North America! <br />

        Revolutionize your cooking with the advanced technology of ROPOT, the
        new kitchen appliance with 8 convenient, pre-programmed functions.
        <br />

        • Stir-fry • Pan-fry • Deep-fry • Sauté <br />

        • Braise/Steam • Stew • Roast • Manual <br />

        Plus a Toss function that is especially helpful when dishes require
        additional seasoning upon completion. <br />

        RECIPE FOR AN ‘ALMOST' HANDS-FREE’STIR-FRY <br />

        Assemble your ingredients, add to Ropot, close the lid, and select
        Stir-Fry. Then sit back, relax, and wait 3 minutes or so while Ropot
        does the cooking for you. <br />

        the built-in paddle stirs your own fresh, healthy ingredients and keeps
        foods moving at just the right speed; <br />
        the upper and lower elements cook foods to perfection; <br />
        the function shuts off automatically to prevent over-cooking; and <br />
        the seal-tight lid keeps spatters inside Ropot where they belong! <br />
        Oh, did we mention the generous, 4-inch deep by 10-inch diameter,
        triple-layer, non-stick pot that makes clean-up as easy as pie?

        1. Exercise extreme caution when opening Ropot’s lid during or after a
        heating cycle. Always use an oven mitt. <br />

        the center of the lid when the unit is in operation. <br />

        4. Remove inner pot using pot handle. Do not touch any other surface of
        pot when hot. <br />

        <br />
        6. Do not fill the inner pot above the 3L line. <br />

        1. The power cord or plug suffers from expansion, deformation,
        discoloration, or other damage. <br />
        2. A portion of the power cord or plug becomes otter than usual. <br />
        3. Ropot heats abnormally or emits a burnt smell. <br />
        4. There are unusual sounds or vibrations when powered on. <br />
