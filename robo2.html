        <h1>This article is about mechanical robots. For software agents</h1>
        <p>The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[4] <br> as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. <br> These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, <br>
             or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired <br> by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch <br> of robotics: soft robotics.</p>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots.[11] <br> There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, <br> and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: <br> accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, <br> operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, <br> and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals. <br>[12][13] Related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology, <br> which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to living things than to machines.</p>

        <h1>Early beginnings</h1>
        <p>Many ancient mythologies, and most modern religions include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek <br> god Hephaestus[18] (Vulcan to the Romans), the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and Galatea, the mythical statue of Pygmalion that came to life. <br> Since circa 400 BC, myths of Crete include Talos, a man of bronze who guarded the island from pirates.</p>
