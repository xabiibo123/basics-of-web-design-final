        <p>In today's industry applications, robot and articulated manipulator systems are widely used because of their advantages in continuous operation, minimum cycle time and lowest error rate parameters. In this study, the Rigid Dynamic Analysis of the articulated manipulator, whose 2-D model was drawn, extracted with Polylactic Acid (PLA) raw material in a 3D printer and assembled in accordance with the tolerances, was carried out using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Angular Velocity parameter. As a result of the calculated analysis, Angular Velocity ùúî=0.1 rad/s and Total Deformation applied to the manipulator were obtained as 3.933 N. As a result of the calculated analysis, Angular Velocity applied to the manipulator was obtained as ùúî=0.1 rad/s, while Total Deformation was obtained as 3.933 N. According to the Rigid Dynamic Analysis results obtained from the study, the design was improved by using different raw materials in Ansys software. For different angular rotation parameters, the endpoint static displacements and the total deformation stresses on the manipulator when the industrial manipulator reaches different points in the three-dimensional working space are numerically calculated. As a result of using different raw materials, 1.5209 N was obtained for Aluminum.</p>
