        <p>Robot - Automatons, which were mostly used for entertainment purposes in these centuries, were a favorite of wealthy palaces. Side: One of the automatons developed for the organ player Ottoman Palace, made by the French mechanic Pierre Jaquet Droz in 1776, was the chess player built by [Baron Von Kempelen] in 1769. This vending machine was exhibited at the Vienna and Moscow fairs. However, later on, it was claimed that people were hidden inside this automaton. It had a complex mechanism that could calculate probabilities thanks to a metal cylinder powered by a mainspring and cams on it. These systems, which were similar to Laterna mechanics in those years, would later inspire Thomas Alva Edison and Edison would invent the gramophone by replacing the cylinder with fixed cams with a writable wax cylinder. This example is a striking example of how inventions did not fall from the sky in history.

            Musician by Pierre Kintzing in 1785. According to the value judgments of the period, the woman who played the Harpsicord, a kind of percussive acoustic instrument with a very aesthetic appearance, could be considered the android of the period. This example, which is in the museum in France today, was also powered by a spring. These automatons were indeed complex machines that could play many pieces of music. Europe's know-how was due to watchmaking and mechanical mastery, which was at its peak at that time. For watchmakers and mechanics skilled in making very small parts, automaton building was a unique opportunity to assert themselves in court and in noble circles.
            
            Developed by a mechanic named Charles Roberts, the history of the automatons in this example is unknown. However, his pictures are included in a book published in the 19th century. Automatons exhibited in the French national museum skillfully make extremely complex drawings. In addition, automatons that could write in poetry were working with the principle of spring - cam.</p>
